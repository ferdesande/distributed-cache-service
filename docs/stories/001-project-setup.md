# Story 001: Project Setup

## User Story
As a developer, I want to have a well-structured Spring Boot project with Kotlin so that I can start 
implementing the cache service.

## Description
This story establishes basic SpringBoot configuration, documents how to work with the project and define the
steps in the development of the project. 

One of the project goals is to be AI-friendly. So every user story must be documented in a story card with a defined
style to help AI agents to interact with the projects in the future.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create Spring Boot project.
- [ ] Have at least one smoke test to make sure the application works
- [ ] Write the global README, the stories README and add a MIT license file

## Technical Considerations
- Use Gradle with Kotlin DSL for build configuration
- Spring Boot 3.x with minimal dependencies (no web dependencies yet)
- Kotlin 1.9+ compatibility
- JDK 21+ target
- Standard Spring Boot project structure as base
- Package structure should reflect architectural boundaries

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Smoke test written and passing
- [ ] Write fist user stories
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Add linting with Detekt

## Implementation Notes

- Start with minimal Spring Boot starter (no web, no redis yet)
- Create empty package structure with placeholder classes/interfaces
- Ensure .gitignore excludes build artifacts, IDE files, and logs
- Set up Gradle wrapper for consistent builds across environments

## Dependencies
- None (this is the foundational story)

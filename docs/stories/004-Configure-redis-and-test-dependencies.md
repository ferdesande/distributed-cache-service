# Story 004: Configure Redis and test dependencies

## User Story
As a developer, I want to configure Redis connectivity and test infrastructure 
so that I can develop and test the cache implementation reliably.

## Description
This story adds Redis client dependencies and sets up TestContainers for integration testing. It establishes 
the foundation for implementing and testing Redis operations without requiring a local Redis installation.

## Expected project structure
```
src/
├── main/
│   └── kotlin/
│       └── com/fsg/cacheservice/
│           └── configuration/
│               └── RedisConfiguration.kt
└── test/
    └── kotlin/
        └── com/fsg/cacheservice/
            ├── integration/
            │   └── RedisConnectionTest.kt
            └── testcontainers/
                └── RedisTestContainer.kt
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Redis and test containers are added
- [ ] A Redis client is used
- [ ] Redis must be available through a TestContainer test

## Technical Considerations
- TestContainers is used for integration tests with Redis

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Dependencies
- It can be done after [Cache Repository Definition](003-Cache-Repository-definition.md).

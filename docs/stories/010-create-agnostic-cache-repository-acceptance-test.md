# Story 010: Create Repository Agnostic Layer Acceptance Tests

## User Story
As a developer, I want to create acceptance tests for CacheRepository so that I can ensure any implementation 
(Redis, in-memory, or future alternatives) meets the same behavioral contract.

## Description
Create an abstract test class that defines the complete behavioral specification for CacheRepository implementations.
These tests will be technology-agnostic and focus on validating the core business logic and contracts at the 
repository layer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Abstract test class CacheRepositoryTestAcceptanceTest created in core package
- [ ] Complete test coverage for all CacheRepository operations:
    - [ ] Basic key-value operations (set, get, delete)
    - [ ] TTL operations with expiration scenarios
    - [ ] Increment operations with overflow and type validation
    - [ ] Ranked element operations with sorting and positioning
- [ ] Cross-operation interactions and edge cases
- [ ] Exception scenarios properly tested with specific exception types
- [ ] Concurrency test to validate thread-safety requirements

## Technical Considerations

- Tests must be implementation-agnostic. Any implementation of the cache must pass the test suite
- Include comprehensive edge cases and error scenarios
- 
## Definition of Done
- [ ] Acceptance test written
- [ ] ArchUnit tests updated passing
- [ ] Code reviewed

## Definition of Done

- [] Acceptance test written
- [ ] ArchUnit tests updated passing
- [ ] Code reviewed

## Implementation Notes

- Place in `com.fsg.cacheservice.core` package alongside the interface
- Use parameterized tests where appropriate for comprehensive coverage
- Include integration-style test that exercises multiple operations together
- Ensure tests validate exact Redis-compatible behavior for sorted sets

## Dependencies
- None (all features already implemented)

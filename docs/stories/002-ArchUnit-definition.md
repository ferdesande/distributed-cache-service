# Story 002: ArchUnit definition

## User Story
As a developer, I want to have architectural rules validated automatically so that the onion architecture principles
are enforced throughout the project lifecycle.

## Description
This story implements ArchUnit testing to ensure that the defined package structure and architectural boundaries 
are respected. The tests will validate dependency directions, package access rules, and architectural constraints
defined in our onion architecture approach.

## Expected project structure
```
src/
├── main/
│   └── kotlin/
│       └── com/fsg/cacheservice/
│           ├── CacheServiceApplication.kt
│           ├── api/
│           ├── core/
│           ├── infrastructure/
│           │   └── redis/
│           └── configuration/
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define architecture in the architecture.puml file
- [ ] Make sure the tests don't fail because the empty folders
- [ ] Create an architecture folder withing the test folder to place there the tests

## Technical Considerations
- Use ArchUnit for architectural testing
- Spring-specific annotations should be restricted to configuration and infrastructure layers

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Implementation Notes
- Specific implementation details
- Edge cases to consider
- Performance considerations

## Dependencies
- It can be done after [Project Setup story is done](001-project-setup.md).

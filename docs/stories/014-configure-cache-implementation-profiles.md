# Story 014: Configure Cache Implementation By Using Different Profiles for Each Implementation

## User Story
As a developer, I want to configure which cache implementation to use via Spring configuration properties
so that I can easily switch between Redis and in-memory cache for different environments.

## Description
Implement Spring configuration profiles to dynamically select between Redis and in-memory cache implementations
by setting configuration properties.

The abstract API tests must run against both implementations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Spring configuration profiles created for cache implementation selection
- [ ] Redis implementation loadable via 'redis' profile
- [ ] In-memory implementation loadable via 'memory' profile
- [ ] Default profile configuration established to memory
- [ ] Abstract API tests running successfully against both implementations
- [ ] Configuration property to select cache implementation
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration examples provided
- [ ] Both implementations pass all API acceptance tests

## Technical Considerations
- Use Spring `@ConditionalOnProperty` for bean selection
- Ensure graceful configuration validation on startup

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Configuration profiles implemented and tested
- [ ] Both cache implementations selectable via configuration properties
- [ ] API tests passing for both Redis and in-memory implementations
- [ ] Configuration documented in README
- [ ] ArchUnit tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Implementation Notes
- Configuration property: `cache.implementation=redis|memory`
- Provide application.yml examples for different environments

## Dependencies
- [Refactor API test for implementation-agnostic](013-refactor-api-test-for-implementation-agnostic-test.md)

# Story 008: Document application setup

## User Story
As a new developer joining the team, I want to configure and start the cache service
so I can quickly get the service running locally and begin development work.

## Description
Document the setup process to allow newcomers to configure the application and start
working quickly in their local development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] README.md contains prerequisites (Java version, Redis setup)
- [ ] Step-by-step instructions to run the application locally
- [ ] Configuration examples for local development
- [ ] Basic API usage examples
- [ ] Instructions verified by following them on a clean environment

## Technical Considerations
- Focus on local development setup only
- Include Redis installation/configuration steps
- Document application.properties for local dev

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Documentation written
- [ ] Setup instructions tested on clean machine
- [ ] Application starts successfully following the README

## Dependencies
- None (all features already implemented)

# Story 005: Implement Cache Repository with Redis

## User Story
As a developer, I want to implement the cache repository interface using Redis so that the cache service 
has a working backend storage solution.

## Description
This story implements the CacheRepository interface defined in [Story 003](003-Cache-Repository-definition.md)
using Redis as the backend. The implementation will be placed in the `infrastructure.redis` package 
and will provide all the Redis operations specified in the interface contract.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All the operations described in the cache repository story must be implemented
- [ ] Make sure the expiration time is working
- [ ] Write comprehensive integration test using test containers
- [ ] Remove Redis integration test created in [Story 004](004-Configure-redis-and-test-dependencies.md) if not needed.
- [ ] Make sure Redis atomicity works as expected
- [ ] Wrap any Redis exception around an unchecked CacheException created.

## Technical Considerations
- Redis exceptions are hidden with CacheExceptions
- Consider serialization/deserialization for complex objects
- All implemented methods must be covered with integration tests

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing
- [ ] ArchUnit tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Implementation Notes
- Specific implementation details
- Edge cases to consider
- Performance considerations

## Dependencies
It can be done after:
- [Cache Repository Definition](003-Cache-Repository-definition.md).
- [Configure Redis and Test dependencies](004-Configure-redis-and-test-dependencies.md).

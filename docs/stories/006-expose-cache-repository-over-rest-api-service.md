# Story 006: Expose Cache Repository over REST API Service

## User Story
As a developer, I want to access the cache service through REST API endpoints so that I can integrate cache 
operations from any HTTP client or external service.

## Description
This story implements a complete REST API layer that exposes all cache repository functionality through HTTP endpoints.
The API must expose all CacheRepository operation. All endpoints must be documented in OpenAPI specification.
API security is not a concern at this point since there is no plan to deploy it soon.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All cache repository operations are exposed through REST endpoints
- [ ] Basic input validation is implemented (non-empty keys, valid ranges)
- [ ] API behavior is testable with Spring Boot Test
- [ ] Complete OpenAPI specification is documented in [openapi.yaml](../api/openapi.yaml)

## Technical Considerations
- Implement DTOs from the designed Open API spec
- Validate input parameters (key format, range values)
- Return appropriate Content-Type headers

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing
- [ ] ArchUnit tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Complete OpenAPI specification is documented in docs/openapi.yaml
- [ ] Manual testing with cURL commands completed

## Dependencies
There is no dependency at this point. Since all previous stories have been completed before writing this one.
